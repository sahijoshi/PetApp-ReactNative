# Pet App - React Native

Pet App is built using JavaScript and React Native framework. Basically, the app has a Welcome Screen, Login Screen, Home Screen, and Detail Page. Home Screen displays pets with categories in top tab bar. The detail screen displays pet details with brief description.

The app demonstrates the use of props, state, and hooks using functional component and to transfer data between screens. Also, it gives an idea of how to create components based on design requirements.
